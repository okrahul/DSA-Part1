# DSA-Part1

Array Methods and DSA Logics
This project contains a variety of array methods and DSA logics. The methods are implemented in TypeScript and can be used to solve a variety of problems.

Array Methods
The following array methods are implemented in this project:

push(): Adds an element to the end of the array.
pop(): Removes the last element from the array.
shift(): Removes the first element from the array.
unshift(): Adds an element to the beginning of the array.
indexOf(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element in the array.
lastIndexOf(): Returns the index of the last occurrence of an element in the array.
slice(): Returns a new array that contains a slice of the original array.
concat(): Returns a new array that is the concatenation of two or more arrays.
DSA Logics
The following DSA logics are implemented in this project:

Bubble sort: Sorts an array in ascending order.
Selection sort: Sorts an array in ascending order by selecting the smallest element and swapping it with the first element.
Insertion sort: Sorts an array in ascending order by inserting elements into the correct position.
Merge sort: Sorts an array by recursively splitting the array into two halves and then merging the sorted halves.
Quicksort: Sorts an array by recursively partitioning the array around a pivot element.
How to Use
To use this project, you can clone the repository and then run the npm install command. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the npm start command to start the development server. The project will be hosted at localhost:3000.
